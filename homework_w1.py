TASK 1

Write a class to represent a Cash Register.
Your class should keep the state of price total and purchased items

Below is a starter code:
------------------------
1. you can add new variables and function if you want to
2. you will NEED to add accepted method parameters where required.
For example, method add_item probably accepts some kind of an item?..
3. You will need to write some examples of how your code works.

    def __init__(self, discount=0):

        self.total_items = dict() #None  {'item': 'price'}

        self.discount = discount

    def add_item(self, item, price):
        self.items = self.items.append(item.price) #This adds an item
        self.total_items = self.items.append(item) #This adds item to total price

    def remove_item(self, item, price):
        self.items= self.items.pop(itemprice)
        self.total_items = self.items.pop(item) #This removes an item from total price
        return ("You have removed an item from your basket")

    def apply_discount(self): #This discounts deducts 10% when you spend 50 or over
        discount= self.total_price / 10
        if self.total_price >= 50:
            price= self.total_price -( self.total_price/ self.discount)
            return price

        else:
            return "Discount is not eligible, please spend Â£50 or over to receive 10% off "

        return "Hello, your total for today is", self.total_price

TASK 2

Write a base class to represent a student. Below is a starter code. 
Feel free to add any more new features to your class. 
As a minimum a student has a name and age and a unique ID.

Create a new subclass from student to represent a concrete student doing a specialization, for example:
Software Student and Data Science student.

# class CFGStudent(<should inherit from Student>)
#     create new methods that manage student's subjects (add/remove new subject and its grade to the dict)
#     create a method to view all subjects taken by a student
#     create a method  (and a new variable) to get student's overall mark (use average)
